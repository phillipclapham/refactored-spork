### Project Specification Sheet: Terminal-Based AI Conversation App

#### Project Name

**AI Chat Arena with Moderator**

#### Objective

Create a command-line application that enables a 4-way conversation between a human user, three conversational AIs (AI1, AI2, AI3), and a dedicated moderator AI (AI-Mod). The AIs can respond to the human and each other, while the human and AI-Mod collaborate to guide the discussion.

#### Basic Sketch of the Idea

- **Concept**: A terminal interface where a human initiates a topic, three AIs respond and debate among themselves, and a fourth AI (moderator) oversees the conversation, interjecting to steer or summarize based on human input or its own logic.
- **Flow Example**:
  1. Human: “What’s the best movie genre?”
  2. AI1: “Action—explosions rule.”
  3. AI2: “Drama, it’s deeper.”
  4. AI3: “Comedy, life’s too serious.”
  5. AI-Mod: “AI1, why explosions over depth?”
  6. (Cycle continues, human/AI-Mod guide as needed.)
- **Goal**: Simulate a structured group chat with AI personalities, moderated for coherence and fun.

#### Key Features

1. **Terminal Interface**:
   - Text-based input/output displaying messages from Human, AI1, AI2, AI3, and AI-Mod.
   - Clear labeling (e.g., “AI1: [text]”) and optional timestamps.
2. **Conversation Logic**:
   - Human starts with a prompt.
   - AI1, AI2, AI3 respond to the human, then to each other’s latest messages.
   - AI-Mod monitors full history, interjects with guidance or prompts.
   - Human can “whisper” to AI-Mod (e.g., “Tell AI2 to explain more”).
3. **Moderation**:
   - AI-Mod maintains focus, civility, or topic relevance, adjustable via human input.
4. **Output Display**:
   - Sequential message log, updated per turn.

#### Technical Requirements

1. **Programming Language**:
   - Python (recommended for simplicity and robust libraries).
2. **Dependencies**:
   - `requests` or `aiohttp` (for API calls).
   - `asyncio` or `threading` (for concurrent API requests, optional).
3. **AI APIs**:
   - Four API integrations:
     - AI1, AI2, AI3: Conversational models (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or similar).
     - AI-Mod: A model with strong reasoning (e.g., a larger GPT variant or Grok).
   - API keys for authentication.
4. **Core Components**:
   - **Input Loop**: Capture human input via terminal (`input()` in Python).
   - **API Handler**: Manage four API calls per turn:
     - Pass human prompt + prior AI responses as context.
     - Parse JSON responses for text output.
   - **Context Manager**: Limit history sent to APIs (e.g., last 3-5 exchanges).
   - **Display Formatter**: Print messages with labels in terminal.
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle API timeouts/failures with fallback messages (e.g., “AI3 is offline”).
6. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Async API calls for speed.
   - Config file for API keys and AI prompts.

#### Development Steps

1. **Setup**:
   - Install Python, required libraries, and secure API keys.
   - Choose four AI models/APIs.
2. **Prototype Interface**:
   - Build a basic terminal loop: human types, app echoes input.
3. **API Integration**:
   - Connect one AI, test a single response cycle.
   - Expand to AI1, AI2, AI3 with inter-AI context passing.
   - Add AI-Mod with full-history access.
4. **Conversation Logic**:
   - Code turn-based flow: human → AIs → AI-Mod.
   - Enable human-to-AI-Mod side channel (e.g., prefix like “/mod”).
5. **Polish**:
   - Format output cleanly.
   - Add basic error handling.
6. **Test**:
   - Run sample convos (e.g., “Best food?”), tweak AI prompts for personality.

#### Resources Needed

- **Hardware**: Basic computer (terminal runs locally, APIs are cloud-based).
- **Software**: Python 3.x, text editor/IDE (e.g., VS Code).
- **Budget**: API usage costs (varies by provider—some offer free tiers).
- **Time**: 10-20 hours for a basic working version, depending on experience.

#### Potential Challenges

- **API Latency**: Sequential calls may slow the app; concurrency could complicate coding.
- **Context Limits**: APIs cap input size—history trimming needed.
- **AI Behavior**: Tuning prompts to make AIs distinct and AI-Mod effective.

#### Deliverable

A functional terminal app where a human can chat with three AIs debating each other, moderated by a fourth AI, all via API-driven text exchanges.

That’s the spec! It’s a roadmap to get you from idea to a working app without drowning in details. Ready to pick your AIs or start coding—or want to tweak anything first?
